This is an attempt to implement RK4 with CUDA, executed directly from the browser with typescript. It is because
previously, it takes a long time (about 5 seconds) to trace out 6 * 6 * 6 field lines with RK4. In an ideal world, 
the computation can be transpiled into shader language, and performed in parallel for each of the field lines.
