<section id="about">
I'm Yuelong Li. Recently graduated from NYU with majors in mathematics and physics. I am interested in theoretical sociology and emergent systems, building transparent artificial intelligence, computer graphics and parallel computing, and physics formalisms. I believe extending the formalisms of theoretical physics can bridge the gap of unknowns in AI and predictive sociology, and am actively searching for opportunities to contribute to these fields.
